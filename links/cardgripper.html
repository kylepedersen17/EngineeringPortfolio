			<p id="about1">
				I worked on this project with a small group as a part of the Enabletech club at UC Berkeley, a club that designs and builds assistive products for people with disabilities. I was fortunate to join a project that aimed to help a local woman with limited arm mobility have a more self-sufficient and independent experience using ATM machines. Our goal was to design a device for her that was capable of gripping, inserting, and taking out credit/debit cards from ATMs.
			</p>

				My group firstly consulted with our client about her needs and visions for a potential product. After coming up with several ideas, we decided on the design ideas listed below. We then met more times with our client for her to test our prototypes and give us feedback for future improvements. After a few months of brainstorming, prototyping, and testing, we presented a final design in December, 2019, which worked while testing at an ATM with her, although there were minor improvements that were completed in January, 2020 while I was away for a semester break at an internship, including slightly changing the angle of the gripper mouth to face towards the handle.

			<figcaption class="figure-caption">This was the final design iteration. It worked by sliding one hand into the handle as shown and using the other arm's wrist to press down on the lever. In the neutral position, the spring-driven lever held the credit card tightly and was released as the ATM took the card. Once complete, the gripper fit just enough to grab the card and bring it back. Compared to the leftmost design of the 3 below images, we ended up making the grip more rounded with edge fillets. We also decreased the height of the handle, added grip around the handle, and concealed the spring.</figcaption>

			</div>

			<figcaption class="figure-caption">Above are three initial design iterations, with the leftmost spring-loaded lever design being the final design route we ended up choosing. The middle design is similar to the final design, except it has a U-shaped clamp. The rightmost design featured a link mechanism that converted the lever motion to a grasping motion at the end.</figcaption>

			<p id="about1">
				This was the first group engineering project I worked on where I was directly involved in creating a custom product for a client while receiving feedback along the way. It was really endearing to see the feedback and have the conversations we had during the design process, and I enjoyed having a personable experience that connected all of our design work back to someone who would use our product in their day-to-day life.
