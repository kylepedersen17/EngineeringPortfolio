				Modern day quadcopter technology allows for intricate light shows that feature multiple drones in coordination moving from one location to the next. It is unclear if current implementations utilize optimal control policies for their movement, so we set out to incorporate model predictive control (MPC) into a central planner & controller to coordinate the movement of multiple drone agents. The MPC algorithm takes in a target location and returns the reference trajectory and closed-loop control input that drive each agent to its respective destination while avoiding collisions with other agents. In our results, we found, as expected, that increasing the number of agents significantly increased the runtime, but we were successful in controlling up to 4 agents going from their own starting and ending positions.

				Quadcopters are an emerging technology utilized within a range of applications throughout multiple societal and governmental sectors that include, but are not limited to, wildfire surveillance, unoccupied land surveillance, weather broadcasting, and nuclear power plant inspections. In many situations, multiple drones would be needed to effectively and/or efficiently handle an objective2. However, this sets up an obstacle for the drones to situate their space and movement within their environment to avoid collisions with other drones. Furthermore, it would add to their efficiency to optimize their paths from point A to point B. Therefore, our objective is to deal with that situation via a multi-agent model predictive control (MPC) system. And for our setting, we plan to position the drones within a 3D environment, in such a way that would outline an image within an open space. Throughout our design, we consider crucial drone dynamics that are presented within any quadcopter, and model a MPC algorithm that minimizes the route a drone takes to reach their destination. We then simulate the results and discuss the limitations and benefits of our control system.

				We use a state space quadcopter model as defined in “Mathematical Modelling of a Quadrotor.” In this paper, the model features a 6DOF quadcopter with four rotors derived from Newtonian equations of motion. Along with x, y, and z position, the drones rotational angles (yaw, pitch, and roll) are defined with ψ, θ, and φ. To add on to the state vector, the time derivatives of each of these 6 states are included, leaving the final state vector in ℝ12.

			For the MPC algorithm to reference the target position, the spatial coordinates of the target position were subtracted from the current state. The cost function was designed to weight the position states most, while the inputs were not weighted through our choice of the control matrix.

				Notable in every example is the presence of MPC-based overshoot for each agent. This is largely due to the formulation of our cost function — while velocity is theoretically minimized, it accounts for only a tiny fraction of the cost function. As a result, our model will generally attempt to overshoot the destination, opting to get as close to the final position as quickly as possible, with the velocity objectives only coming into practical effect as the agentss settle on their final position.

			This overshoot is also reflected in our optimal costs, which, while tending to decrease, were not always monotonically decreasing. This is in addition to feasibility errors we’d come across when we ran our simulation with too small a time horizon or distant end positions (encouraging high velocities that led to collisions). In addition, it’s worth noting that this algorithm’s runtime — especially as the number of agents increases — would not be suitable for online calculation, but rather an offline method of path generation.

			While it is definitely possible to use centralized MPC for path planning, path following, and collision avoidance, doing it for the number of agents involved in a drone light show is computationally infeasible. This is because the number of state variables increases linearly with the number of agents, which causes the size of the matrices defining state dynamics to increase quadratically. This is especially an issue with the time varying and non-linear B matrices used to model the effects of different inputs. However, we showed that MPC can be a flexible and robust method for central control of small numbers of drones.

			More efficient methods could involve precomputing flight paths and using an MPC solely for path following and collision avoidance for each quadcopter. Researchers have also been able to limit the size of the MPC problem, namely through decentralization.5 By creating a communication protocol between every drone in a flock, it is possible to use a separate MPC to plan and follow paths for each drone while still guaranteeing collision avoidance.
