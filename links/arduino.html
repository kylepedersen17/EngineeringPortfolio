					<strong>About: </strong>This project was appealing to me because it incorporated many different components into one central device - it had four main components: an ultrasonic sensor, a button, a potentiometer, and an RGB LED light. The ultrasonic sensor would be continuously reading a distance value, and when the distance value was smaller than a certain value (i.e. when your hand was up close), the LED would then turn on or off (depending on the previous on/off state of the LED). The device also supported dimming and brightening the light when the potentiometer was turned. Perhaps the most interesting part of the project in my opinion was the RGB light’s ability to change color when the button was pressed. I programmed this capability by storing different red, green, and blue values in distinct arrays and switched the LED state when the button was pressed.

				<strong>Project challenges: </strong>The main difficulty I had with this project was figuring out how to ensure that 1) the ultrasonic sensor would provide enough time to allow one’s hand to turn on the light and 2) the LED would remain on. Also, both the LED and Ultrasonic sensor had several wires and resistors that would disrupt the entire device's circuitry, so I had to be meticulous while debugging and isolate each component into sub-problems until the LED and sensor were functioning as expected.

				<strong>What I learned: </strong>Configuring an Arduino setup is interesting because the components themselves are not connected at all yet interact with one another seamlessly. For example, the potentiometer has zero connection to the LED, yet when the potentiometer is adjusted, its voltage output is passed through the microcontroller and through the LED as an input signal. Looking back, this was a core idea I picked up in my engineering courses later in college. There is not necessarily a need for components themselves to be connected, but as long as there are signals being communicated, that is powerful enough to control an even larger mechanism.

				<strong>About: </strong>This was really the first Arduino project I embarked on that wasn't just a "Hello World" project (i.e. making a motor turn or an LED blink once). The ultrasonic sensor would be constantly reading a distance value by bouncing a signal off of the wall, and it was my task to then convert its SONAR output value with to miles per hour which would then be printed out on the serial monitor. The finished product was remarkable accurate: the observed value of around 772 MPH was just 0.61% off of 767.3 MPH, the actual speed of sound in MPH. However, this is negligible because the reference distance I used of 6 inches would mean achieving 767.3 MPH would be an adjusted sensor position of a fraction of an inch.

				<strong>Project challenges: </strong>This was the first time that I used the ultrasonic sensor, so configuring the wiring was a bit tedious. Also, the ultrasonic sensor's values also were prone to rapid fluctuation, so using the read values and converting them to a steady scale took a few trials to get a good base average reading from the ultrasonic sensor.
			</p>
			<p id="about2">
				<strong>What I learned: </strong>The big idea in this project was being able to make use of an input signal I may not necessarily be interested in and convert it to meaningful data - in this case, it was taking the SONAR reading from the ultrasonic sensor and converting it to MPH. Signals are everywhere in mechatronics, and this was a good first step in not only making a useful end product but also being able to convert data into its final desired form.

				The Kanye quote API generates a random quote said at one point by Kanye West, and I found it to be a good test for figuring out how to communicate between a webpage and an Arduino. The webpage from which the quote is generated sends the quote to the Arduino web server that is hosted on the Ethernet shield. The quote can then be processed by the Arduino.
