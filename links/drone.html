			<p>
				&nbsp; This solar-powered drone was the capstone project for the yearlong PLTW Engineering Research & Design course I took as a senior in high school. The class gave us the latitude to design and build any engineering project we wanted, and after brainstorming different ideas, we came upon the idea to build a drone that satisfied the following constraints:


				<ul>
					<li>The drone must be wirelessly controlled</li>
					<li>The drone must be able to control & monitor yaw, pitch, and roll</li>
					<li>The drone must dock to a chargin interface</li>
					<li>The drone must be able to deliver a 1 lb. payload 0.5 miles away within 3 ft. of its destination</li>
					<li>The charging station must use clean energy</li>
					<li>The charging station must charge the drone wirelessly</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<figcaption class="figure-caption">In the end, the drone was able to pick up and drop off the payload while flying properly, but there were energy problems with the charging station.</figcaption>

			<p>
				&nbsp; The team consisted of me and three other classmates, and we used the entire first semester to plan out our design for the drone and begin ordering parts, while the spring semester was alloted for drone building and testing. With so many tasks to be completed and much organization necessary, I took along the role of being the project manager along with being responsible for designing, building, and testing the payload component. The others, respectively, were mostly in charge of building and tweaking the drone kit, configuring the large solar panel we ordered, and setting up the wireless charging station. We also helped each other out, but there was always one main person in charge of each project subcomponent.

			<p id="about1">
				&nbsp; This project really helped our engineering skills develop because we were essentially on our own with designing and assembling the project. We did, however, have access to our teacher, who gave us more high-level recommendations, and weekly meetings with Boeing mentors who could assist with more technical questions.
			</p>
			<p>
				As project manager, I was in charge of the weekly planning of the project (which I kept track of with a Gantt chart) as well as sending update emails to our teacher and the Boeing mentors.
